This project reflects my enthusiasm for exploring the interaction between geospatial market proximity and crop pattern change. 
This dashboard was developed as part of the CoRE Stack Innovation Challenge on Geospatial Programming – 1st Edition (December 2025). I would like to extend my sincere gratitude to the CoRE Stack team for providing the comprehensive data—including multi-temporal LULC rasters that made this deep-dive analysis of the Nashik agricultural landscape possible.
